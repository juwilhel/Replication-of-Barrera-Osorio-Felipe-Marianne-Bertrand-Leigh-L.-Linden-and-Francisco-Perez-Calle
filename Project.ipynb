    "The different treatments were implemented in two localities in Bogota, San Cristobal and Suba. Since it is impossible to observe treatment effects at the individual level, researchers thus estimate average effects using treatment and control groups. Eligible children in San Cristobal were randomly assigned between a control group, the basic treatment (bi-monthly transfer) and the savings treatment (bi-monthly transfer combined with a lump-sum payment at the time students are supposed to re-enroll in school). In Suba eligible children were randomly assigned to the tertiary treatment (bi-monthly transfer combined with a large payment upon graduation) and a control group. For each individual $i$ we can image a potential outcome where they are treated $Y_i(1)$ and where they are not $Y_i(0)$ but we can never simultaneously observe both outcomes for each individual. The random treatment assignment allows the authors to experimentally estimate the causal effects of the three treatments. While they directly can compare the effect of the basic and savings treatment, comparing those with the tertiary treatment they cannot rely on purely random variation. This is because the tertiary treatment was implemented in another locality and therefore, the comparison to the tertiary treatment occurs across experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since treatments were assigned randomly within the two localities, potential outcomes are independent of $D$ and the selection bias is eliminated.
