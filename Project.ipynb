    "Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) compare three education-based conditional cash transfer designs aimed at incentivizing academic participation. Using data from a pilot study in Bogota, Colombia they examine the effects of a bi-monthly transfer (basic treatment), a bi-monthly transfer combined with a lump-sum payment at the time students are supposed to re-enroll in school (savings treatment) and a bi-monthly transfer combined with a large payment upon graduation (tertiary treatment). The payments are conditional on school attendence of the child and designed to prevent dropout from secondary schools and to encourage matriculation at tertiary institutions. On the one hand, the savings and tertiary treatment impose more binding short-term liquidity constraints on participating families than the basic treatment. The authors examine whether this decreases monthly school attendence. On the other hand, they might provide stronger incentives for families to re-enroll their children at school or for graduation. \n",

The Secretary of Education of the City implemented a pilot study running for one year, where they randomly allocated treatments to children in two localities. They randomize at child-level, generating variation within schools and families. This allows the authors to assess comparability of different groups. Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) find that all designs significantly increase attendance and that the savings and tertiary treatments increase enrollment rates more strongly than the basic treatment. They conclude that the structure of the intervention can help targeting resources.\n",

    "The different treatments were implemented in two localities in Bogota, San Cristobal and Suba. Eligible children in San Cristobal were randomly assigned between a control group, the basic treatment (bi-monthly transfer) and the savings treatment (bi-monthly transfer combined with a lump-sum payment at the time students are supposed to re-enroll in school). In Suba eligible children were randomly assigned to the tertiary treatment (bi-monthly transfer combined with a large payment upon graduation) and a control group. Since it is impossible to observe treatment effects at the individual level, researchers thus estimate average effects using treatment and control groups. For each individual $i$ we can image a potential outcome where they are treated $Y_i(1)$ and where they are not $Y_i(0)$, but we can never simultaneously observe both outcomes for each individual. The random treatment assignment allows the authors to experimentally estimate the causal effects of the three treatments. While they directly can compare the effect of the basic and savings treatment, comparing those with the tertiary treatment they cannot rely on purely random variation. This is because the tertiary treatment was implemented in another locality and therefore, the comparison to the tertiary treatment occurs across experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since treatments were assigned randomly within the two localities, potential outcomes are independent of $D$ and the selection bias is eliminated.

The authors make 60 comparisons and find 7 differences that are statistically significant at the 10 percent level, 5 at the 5 percent level and 2 at the 1 percent level.

    "## 4.2. Baseline Comparison\n",
    "Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) check that the randomization was successful and created balanced research groups. Therefore, they compare characteristics of students between research groups. Table 2 shows the control group averages of 15 different variables in the basic-savings experiment (B-S) and the tertiary experiment (T). The 4 other columns show 60 comparisons. The standard errors are in the row below each difference, labeled with \"SE\". 7 differences are statistically significant at the 10 percent level (blue), 5 at the 5 percent level (red), and 2 at the 1 percent level (green). One can conclude that treatment is assigned randomly, which supports the identification assumption of their strategy."

    "First, the authors analyse the effect of the conditional cash transfers on the school attendence rate. They here include only individuals who are enrolled in one of the 68 schools selected for surveying. In addition to that, they exclude students who are in grade 11 for the enrollment effect estimations, since they should graduate rather than re-enroll. To be consistent they also restrict the sample to students in grades 6-10 from the estimates of the effect on the attendence rate. In order to replicate their results I run simple regressions of the school attendence rate on the treatment variable without control variables, with demographic controls and with demographic controls and school fixed effects. The first three columns of table 3 show the results for the Basic-Savings experiment in Sancristobal, while columns 4 to 6 show the results for the tertiary experiment in Suba. The last column shows results of a regression containing all three treatments, demographics and school fixed effects. The estimated treatment effects and their standard errors (\"SE\") are provided in rows 1-6 and the test statistics from comparisons of the relative treatment effects and their p-values are in rows 7-10."

    "Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) use data from a follow-up survey which was conducted after the treatments were implemented to analyze the effects of each treatment on self-reported graduation and tertiary enrollment for students who were in grade 11. The sample is restricted to those students, for which the follow-up survey data is provided. In order to replicate the results from Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011), I run regressions of the binary variable for graduation and of the binary variable for tertiary enrollment on the treatment variables with demographic controls and school fixed effects. The first three columns of table 3 show the effects on graduation in the sample of Sancristobal, the sample in Suba and both together. Columns 4 to 6 show the effects on tertiary enrollment, again, in the sample of Sancristobal, the sample in Suba and both together. The estimated treatment effects and their standard errors (\"SE\") are provided in rows 1-6 and the test statistics from comparisons of the relative treatment effects and their p-values are in rows 7-10."

    "Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) analyze the effect of the treatments on school attendence and re-enrollment for siblings. They use the intra-familiy variation in treatment assignment to provide a reduced form test of whether receiving the transfer changes the allocation of opportunities within the household. In order to extract causal effects they restrict their sample to the subset of siblings that were also registered, since otherwise systematic differences between those families who registered one and those who registered two children might bias the results. They focus on families who registered two children and only choose those for which administrative enrollment data is available. They pool the treatments due to the small sample size. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 contain comparisons of untreated children with and without treated siblings. Columns 3 and 4 show comparisons only for girls and columns 5 and 6 for boys."

    "In the following I discuss the quality of the strategy and estimations provided by Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011).  \n",
    "One strength of their analysis is, that they use administrative data for attendence and enrollment. This implies a high quality, since it is not systematically affected by individuals lying or misreporting as survey data might be.  \n",
    "Secondly, they check whether treatments are assigned randomly within the localities. Comparing characteristics they conclude that control and treatment groups are balanced. In addition to that, the fact that regression estimates do not differ strongly when demographics and school fixed effects are included, inplies, that randomization was successful.  \n",
    "Thirdly, in order to rule out spillover effects of the treatment between children through peer networks, Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) check that children in treatment and control group have similar networks. Therefore, any indirect treatment effect would be equally distributed across the groups.  \n",
    "Fourthly, the authors make sure that there is no self selection into treatment. Only children from families, who lived in the localities prior to 2004 were eligible to register for the program. This rules out that families moved to take advantage of the treatments.  \n",
    "Fifthly, they mention that the SISBEN data, which they use for background characteristics, may underestimate assets and income, since the surveyed families knew that they were surveyed for the purpose of scoring them on a poverty index. However, the bias due to this hawthorne effect is not correlated with the differences investigated in the paper given the timing and purpose of the survey.  \n",
    "Sixthly, Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) check whether their baseline and follow-up survey induce a bias due to attrition. They conclude that attrition occurs similar across treatment and control groups, which implies that the results should not be biased.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One problem regarding their analysis is, that the tertiary treatment ends up being more generous than the basic and savings treatment. This makes it difficult to compare the treatments and the effect of the tertiary treatment might be biased upwards compared to the effect of the other two treatments.  \n",
    "Next, they cannot rely on random treatment assignment for comparisons between the treatments in the two experiments. This might bias the result if there are systematic differences of characteristics which at the same time affect treatment assignment and the outcome variable. For example, the fact that the difference in magnitude of the basic and the savings treatment effects on re-enrollment is statistically significant in the regression, where I only consider the experiment in San Cristobal, and not statistically significant in the regression, where I include both locations, indicates this.  \n",
    "Another problem is, that the administrative enrollment data could not be matched to 9.3% of the students in the experiment from San Cristobal, and 8.5% could not be matched in Suba. If the children for which the data could not be matched have characteristics, which systematically affect their enrollment rate, this created a bias.  \n",
    "The results for the effects on graduation and tertiary enrollment relies on survey-based data. Since individuals might lie or misreport information, the results could be biased.  \n",
    "Lastly, the sample size for the tertiary treatment is not very large, which is another weakness of the paper."

    "## 6.1. Check for Balanced Groups across Experiments\n",
    "As mentioned above, considering the experiments in the two localities together in order to compare the effects of all three treatments, the causal graph has three back-door paths which have to be eliminated. Treatment assignment then is not completely random, since it is not random whether a person lives in Suba or San Cristobal. Observable or unobservable factors may affect where a family lives and therefore also treatment assignment and the outcome at the same time. This can be clearly seen, when comparing characteristics of all three treatment groups to each other and to the group of not treated individuals in both localities together. Table 7 shows these comparisons. The first column shows the mean for all not treated children in the sample. The following columns present the differences between the corresponding groups. For each mean and difference standard errors are provided below, denoted by 'SE'. "

Between the basic and the savings treatment group only 2 differences are statistically significant (1 at the 1 percent level and two at the 5 percent level), which we already have seen in table 2. Out of the remaining 75 differences, 57 are statistically significant at the 10 percent level, 55 at the 5 percent level and 44 at the 1 percent level. One can conclude that the treatment and control groups are not similar regarding these characteristics. This suggests, that simple estimates of regressing outcome variables on the treatment might be biased and the back-door paths have to be eliminated."

    "In order to eliminate the back-door paths Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) control for the locality of the householods and a large set of observable demographic characteristics. However, all three back-door paths should be eliminated by simply controling for the locality in which the family lives, since within the localities treatment assignment is random. In the following, I estimate the effects of all three treatments together on attendence and enrollment rates only controlling for the locality. Table 7 shows the results of this regression. I compare my results with those presented in the last column of table 3, respectively table 4. "

    "These estimates are very similar to those presented in the last column of table 3, respectively table 4. For example, the tertiary treatment here is estimated to increase the attendence rate by 5.2 percentage points, table 3 shows an effect of 5.5 percentage points. The largest difference occurs for the effect of the savings treatment on re-enrollment, which is an increase of 2.5 percentage points compared to 3 when we control for demographics and include school fixed effects. However, the results are statistically significant at the same significance levels as in table 3 and 4. Concerning the difference tests of the treatment effects the results differ more strongly, while in none of the cases they are statistically significant. One can conclude that including demographic characteritics and school fixed effects in addition to controlling for the locality in which the family lives does not change the results of the regression with all three treatments. This can be explained by the fact that the back-door paths are blocked by adding the locality to the regression."
