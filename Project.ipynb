    "The different treatments were implemented in two localities in Bogota, San Cristobal and Suba. Since it is impossible to observe treatment effects at the individual level, researchers thus estimate average effects using treatment and control groups. Eligible children in San Cristobal were randomly assigned between a control group, the basic treatment (bi-monthly transfer) and the savings treatment (bi-monthly transfer combined with a lump-sum payment at the time students are supposed to re-enroll in school). In Suba eligible children were randomly assigned to the tertiary treatment (bi-monthly transfer combined with a large payment upon graduation) and a control group. For each individual $i$ we can image a potential outcome where they are treated $Y_i(1)$ and where they are not $Y_i(0)$ but we can never simultaneously observe both outcomes for each individual. The random treatment assignment allows the authors to experimentally estimate the causal effects of the three treatments. While they directly can compare the effect of the basic and savings treatment, comparing those with the tertiary treatment they cannot rely on purely random variation. This is because the tertiary treatment was implemented in another locality and therefore, the comparison to the tertiary treatment occurs across experiments.\n",

    "First, the authors analyse the effect of the conditional cash transfers on the school attendence rate. They here include only individuals who are enrolled in one of the 68 schools selected for surveying. In addition to that, they exclude students who are in grade 11 for the enrollment effect estimations, since they should graduate rather than re-enroll. To be consistent they also restrict the sample to students in grades 6-10 from the estimates of the effect on the attendence rate. In order to replicate their results I run simple regressions of the school attendence rate on the treatment variable without control variables, with demographic controls and with demographic controls and school fixed effects. The first three columns of table 3 show the results for the Basic-Savings experiment in Sancristobal, while columns 4 to 6 show the results for the tertiary experiment in Suba. The last column shows results of a regression containing all three treatments, demographics and school fixed effects. The estimated treatment effects and their standard errors (\"SE\") are provided in rows 1-6 and the test statistics from comparisons of the relative treatment effects and their p-values are in rows 7-10."
