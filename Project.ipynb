    "Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) compare three education-based conditional cash transfer designs aimed at incentivizing academic participation. Using data from a pilot study in Bogota, Colombia they examine the effects of a bi-monthly transfer (basic Treatment), a bi-monthly transfer combined with a lump-sum payment at the time students are supposed to re-enroll in school (savings treatment) and a bi-monthly transfer combined with a large payment upon graduation (tertiary treatment). The payments are conditional on school attendence of the child and designed to prevent dropout from secondary schools and to encourage matriculation at tertiary institutions.\n",

The Secretary of Education of the City implemented a pilot study running for one year, where they randomly allocated treatments to children in two localities. They randomize at child-level, generating variation within schools and families. This allows the authors to assess comparability of different groups. Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) find that all designs significantly increase attendance and that the savings and tertiary treatments increase enrollment rates more strongly than the basic treatment.

    "The different treatments were implemented in two localities in Bogota, San Cristobal and Suba. Since it is impossible to observe treatment effects at the individual level, researchers thus estimate average effects using treatment and control groups. Eligible children in San Cristobal were randomly assigned between a control group, the basic treatment (bi-monthly transfer) and the savings treatment (bi-monthly transfer combined with a lump-sum payment at the time students are supposed to re-enroll in school). In Suba eligible children were randomly assigned to the tertiary treatment (bi-monthly transfer combined with a large payment upon graduation) and a control group. For each individual $i$ we can image a potential outcome where they are treated $Y_i(1)$ and where they are not $Y_i(0)$ but we can never simultaneously observe both outcomes for each individual. The random treatment assignment allows the authors to experimentally estimate the causal effects of the three treatments. While they directly can compare the effect of the basic and savings treatment, comparing those with the tertiary treatment they cannot rely on purely random variation. This is because the tertiary treatment was implemented in another locality and therefore, the comparison to the tertiary treatment occurs across experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since treatments were assigned randomly within the two localities, potential outcomes are independent of $D$ and the selection bias is eliminated.

These information were collected prior to the randomization, which suggests that students in each group should, on average, have similar characteristics. The authors make 60 comparisons and find 7 differences that are statistically significant at the 10 percent level, 5 at the 5 percent level and 2 at the 1 percent level.

Observable or unobservable factors may affect treatment assignment, in other words, the location where the individual lives, and the outcome at the same time. The causal graph then looks as follows:\n",
